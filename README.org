#+TITLE: DOTFILES

This is a another attempt at me "literate programmatising" my dotfile
configuration. I have no idea how long it will last



* Colour

Where possible I have a consistent colour scheme automatically generated based
on my current wallpaper courtesy of the fantastic [[https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal][pywal]] project.

Setting colours for the terminal is easy enough, just reference the generated
config file.

#+NAME: kitty-colors
#+BEGIN_SRC conf
include ~/.cache/wal/colors-kitty.conf
#+END_SRC

* i3

* Final Assembly

In this section all the code blocks defined above are knitted together to form
my configuration that is then tangled to real files on disk.

** Kitty

[[https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/][kitty]] seems to be gaining popularity as a terminal emulator and seems nice
enough with nice features like GPU rendering. The configuration itself is
trivial (at least for now) just setting the font and the colours

#+BEGIN_SRC conf :noweb yes :tangle kitty/kitty.conf
font_size 9
font_family Iosevka

<<kitty-colors>>
#+END_SRC

** X11
*** Xinitrc

This file is called when we invoke ~startx~ and is responsible setting various
configurations before i3 is invoked.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle xinitrc
#! /bin/sh

# Not entirely sure what this does but it seems important.
if [ -d /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d ]; then
  for f in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/*; do
    [ -x "$f" ] && . "$f"
  done
fi

# Use settings in the .Xresources file
xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources

# Disable beeping
xset b off

# Set GB layout, remap CAPS to ESC
setxbmap -layout gb -option caps:escape

# Disable page up / page down keys on my laptop.
xmodmap -e "keycode 166="
xmodmap -e "keycode 167="

# Set the cursor
xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr

# Start i3
exec i3
#+END_SRC
