# Dotfiles

This is a collection of configuration files for various applications that I have used over the years, it
includes configurations for the following applications:

- Awesome WM 
- Compton 
- Conky
- Git 
- Newsbeuter 
- Termite 
- Tmux 
- Vim 
- Xresources 

I think I should consider adding an install script, especially for my vim config. Also I need to consider
importing my zsh configuration as well
