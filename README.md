# Dotfiles

This is a collection of configuration files for various applications that I use, it
includes configurations for the following applications:

- Awesome WM 
- Compton 
- Conky
- Git 
- Termite 
- Tmux 
- Vim 
- Xresources 
- Zsh

I think I should consider adding an install script, especially for my zsh and vim configs.
