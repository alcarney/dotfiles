# Dotfiles

This is a collection of configuration files for various applications that I have used over the years, it
includes configurations for the following applications:

- Compton (A compositor)
- Termite (A terminal emulator)
- Tmux (A terminal multiplexer)
- Newsbeuter (RSS Feed Reader)
- Xresources (Various X settings including fonts and urxvt)
- Conky (System monitor) - this particular configuration displays all the info at the bottom of the screen
- Git (Version control)


I think I should consider adding an install script, especially for my configurations that aren't included directly
in this repository such as my vim,zsh and awesome configurations so that things are truly in a centralised repository

For some configurations such as conky it may be necessary to create a branch that will reflect laptop sepcific settings
etc. so for now on the 'master' branch is reserved for configurations that are system independant.
